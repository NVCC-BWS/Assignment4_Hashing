# Assignment4_Hashing

Look at files in this order:

 1. Hashing.cpp // Your code goes here.
 2. Hashing.h   // The object's you'll be using are defined here.
 3. BENCHMARKS/benchmark_log_1.txt // See what 'good' performance looks like.
 
 4. dataset_1.txt - dataset_6_example.txt // Analyze the contents of each data set, try to write hash functions that evenly distribute these lists of objects.
